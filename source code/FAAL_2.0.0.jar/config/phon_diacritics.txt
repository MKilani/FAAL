% List of diacritics used in the IPA transcriptions
%
% Lines starting with % are ignored.
%
% This file has three columns, and each line corresponds to a diacritic. 
% The first column contains the diacritic character, 
% the second column contains an index indicating if the diacritic character is written 
% before (marked as 1) or after (marked as 0) the phoneme it modifies. 
% Finally, the third column contains the features of the main phonemes that are modified by the diacritic.
% The format of this last column is: 
% nr_of_the_feature_to_be_modified - semicolon - new_value_of_the_feature. 
% When more than one feature is modified by the same diacritic, 
% all the features are listed in the third column 
% according to the format just described, separated by a space (U+0020).
% Columns are separated by the character "	" (horizontal tab character - U+0009).
%
% As a good practice, each row is preceded by a line of comment (introduced by %) describing the function of the diacritic.
