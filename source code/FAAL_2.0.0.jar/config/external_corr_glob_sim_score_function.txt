% External Function
% Lines starting with % are ignored.
% The following variables can be retrieved from the matcher module and used in the scoring function:
%
% SumFeat = total number of features in common between the two words
% NrFeat = number of phonetic features taken into consideration
% LongestWord = length of the longest of the two words being aligned
% ShortestWord = length of the shortest of the two words being aligned
% LenSeq = length of the longest matching sequence, without counting initial or final unmatched pairs.
% LenWord1 = length word 1
% LenWord2 = length word 2
% LenAlign = length of the whole alignment, counting initial or final unmatched pairs.
%
% The following example represent the Corrected Global Similarity Score function presented in the paper. Replace it with the desired costumed function.
%
((SumFeat) / (NrFeat * 7.71)) - ((LenSeq - ShortestWord)/1.04 + ((LenAlign - LenSeq)/LenSeq)) * (1-(ShortestWord/LongestWord))
